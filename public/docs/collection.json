It includes detailed information about the endpoints, their inputs, and outputs, as well as authentication and authorization procedures. The documentation is exported as collections using tools such as Postman or Thunder Client, making it easy to test the API and understand its functionality. The documentation is well-organized, clear, and easy to understand. It is intended for developers who want to integrate their applications with library or for anyone who wants to understand the inner workings of the API.",
